# ice40_Wave
An attempt for a function generator based on Lattice's ice40 fpga

### Description:
The aim of this project is to create a DDS function generator based on a Lattice iCE40HX1K FPGA and paired with a 
TBD microcontroller that will act as a front end and control the generator via SPI.

### Setup Notes:
The project is developed using Lattice iCEcube2
