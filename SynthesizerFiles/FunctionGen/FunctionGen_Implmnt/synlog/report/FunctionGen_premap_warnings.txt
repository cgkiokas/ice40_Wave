@W: MT531 :"c:\users\chris\onedrive\hw_projects\funcgen\vhdl files\async_fifo.vhd":68:4:68:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including async_fifo_inst.quadrant_status.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
